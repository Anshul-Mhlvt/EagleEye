## Overview
This is a computer vision project to detect humans and get the count so that it can be used in various monitoring applications. Used HOG (Histogram Oriented Gradient Descriptor), which is a feature descriptor used for object detection. 
OpenCV combined the HOG algorithm along with Support Vector Machine for effective feature extraction and classification of objects. The in-built people detector functionality is used here to detect the humans and a counter variable to get the number of humans in a picture or a video.
